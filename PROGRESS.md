# PROGRESS

Append-only run log and hand-off note. Newest entry on top. Every session adds one entry:
what it did, test/bench results, what's next, and any blocker. This is how stateless
overnight runs hand off to each other.

## 2026-11-06 — System setup (session: Overnight online-only schedules)

Set up the autonomous-development **system**, not project features:

- `CLAUDE.md` — project knowledge + working agreement.
- `docs/OVERNIGHT_RUN.md` — the overnight run playbook.
- `TASKS.md` — seed backlog + task conventions.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — decision log (seeded from the README's rationale).
- `.claude/agents/` — `bench-runner`, `model-builder`, `reviewer` subagents.
- `.claude/settings.json` — Stop hook reminding runs to commit + push.
- Two nightly scheduled firings (Europe/Brussels, ~21:37 and ~02:37) created **disabled**,
  pending activation.

**State:** the upscaler code is NOT yet on this branch / `main` — it's being pushed by a
separate session. These scaffolding files live on `claude/adoring-wright-qce6ln` via a draft
PR.

**Next (activation, human step):**
1. Land the upscaler code (`package.json`, `src/`, `models/`, tests) on `main`.
2. Merge the scaffolding PR into `main`.
3. Enable the overnight schedule.

Until step 1–2 are both on `main`, any overnight run will correctly detect the missing
bootstrap and no-op (see `docs/OVERNIGHT_RUN.md` §0).
