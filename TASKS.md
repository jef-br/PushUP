# TASKS

The backlog for PushUP. Scheduled overnight runs pick work from here; see
`docs/OVERNIGHT_RUN.md`.

## Conventions

- Status: `[ ]` ready · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[blocked]` waiting on something ·
  `[split]` replaced by sub-tasks (never picked up).
- Each task has an **ID** (stable, used in branch names), a goal, and acceptance criteria.
- One task = one branch (`overnight/<date>-<id>`) = one draft PR.
- Keep tasks small enough to finish and verify in a single ~4-hour window. If a task is
  bigger, split it and add the sub-tasks here first.
- When you claim a task, mark it `[~]` with the date and branch and push that change before
  starting real work.

## Backlog (highest priority first)

> This is a **seed** backlog derived from the README's "Known limits / next steps" plus the
> infrastructure a continuable project needs. Re-prioritise freely; add detail as you learn.

### [x] I1 — CI: run tests on every PR (done 2026-11-08)
- **Goal:** GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm install` and `npm test` on push/PR.
- **Accept:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` present; green on a trivial PR; caches npm.
- **Notes:** Keep it to the runtime package; the Python bench/model tooling is out of scope
  for CI unless cheap to add.

### [x] I4 — Harden tests around the contract edges (done 2026-11-07, branch overnight/2026-11-07-I4)
- **Goal:** Explicit tests for the `RangeError` bounds (399/400/800/801 px largest side),
  `stride` padding (0–2 bytes, odd widths), and the 1000 px output cap (e.g. 800 px @1.5).
- **Accept:** New tests pass; each contract row in `CLAUDE.md` has at least one test.

### [x] T2 — Profile and document upscale latency (done 2026-11-07; see docs/PERF.md)
- **Goal:** Measure per-input-size latency on the standard set and find the dominant cost.
- **Accept:** A short `docs/PERF.md` with a methodology + numbers; one concrete, low-risk
  speed idea written up as a follow-up task (don't implement risky changes unattended).
- **Notes:** README baseline: ~1 s @400 px, ~4 s @800 px on 4 cores.

### [x] T4 — Optional post-sharpen toggle for fine texture (closed 2026-11-09: negative result, not shipped; see D8)
- **Goal:** Evaluate whether a small, optional sharpening step improves perceived fabric
  texture without hurting PSNR/SSIM/GMSD.
- **Accept:** Benchmark comparison (then in `PROGRESS.md`, now in D8); ship only if it's a clear win and
  default-off; otherwise record the negative result and close the task.

### [x] I3 — Package publish readiness (done 2026-11-08, branch overnight/2026-11-08-I3)
- **Goal:** Make `package.json` metadata, `files`/`.npmignore`, and `README` ready for
  `npm publish` (dry run only — do not publish).
- **Accept:** `npm pack` produces a tarball that includes `src/`, `models/*.onnx`, `README`;
  excludes `bench/`, `tools/`, test fixtures. `npm publish --dry-run` clean.

### [x] T5 — Faster `fromTensor` (byte-identical output) (done 2026-11-09: ~5x faster stage, see docs/PERF.md)
- **Outcome:** done with an inline `floor(v * 255 + 0.5)` (exact for float32), not
  `Uint8ClampedArray` (ties-to-even would change bytes). Original goal kept below.
- **Goal:** Replace the per-pixel `Math.round` + clamp loop in `src/index.js`
  (`copyFromTensor` since tiling landed; it was `fromTensor`)
  with a `Uint8ClampedArray`-based write (see `docs/PERF.md`).
- **Accept:** Output bytes identical to the old implementation on test images (add a test
  comparing against a reference clamp); `bench/profile.js` shows the `fromTensor` drop.
- **Notes:** `Uint8ClampedArray` rounds ties to even, `Math.round` rounds half-up, and
  adding 0.5 before the write would double-round (off by one). Byte-identical output may
  not be achievable with the native clamp; if the test shows any difference, drop the idea
  and record the negative result. The `fromTensor` stage is ~6.6% of latency at 800 px;
  the expected saving is smaller (estimate, unmeasured).

### [x] T6 — GPU when available, CPU always; high-quality mode (done 2026-11-09, PR #13)
- **Owner decision (2026-11-09):** every path must run on CPU only; use a GPU when present.
- **Goal:** pick the execution device and model automatically, without changing the `upscale`
  signature: GPU present → Remacri (best texture); CPU → 4xLSDIRCompactC3 (fast).
  Overrides via env: `PUSHUP_QUALITY=auto|fast|high`, `PUSHUP_DEVICE=auto|cpu|gpu`.
- **Accept:**
  - GPU provider per platform (Windows DirectML, Linux x64 CUDA, macOS arm64 CoreML); any
    GPU failure (load or run) falls back to CPU with identical-quality semantics, never an error.
  - `PUSHUP_QUALITY=high` works on CPU (tiled, slow) — tested.
  - Default on a CPU-only machine is byte-identical to before (fast model) — tested.
  - Invalid env values throw a clear error — tested.
  - Remacri ONNX shipped with license/attribution (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
  - Benchmark numbers for both modes recorded; README/CLAUDE.md document the modes.
- **Note:** no GPU in the cloud container; GPU paths are verified only by their fallback.

### [x] T3 — Compare with a SaaS upscaler, without spending (done 2026-11-09, see docs/SAAS.md)
- Owner rule: no accounts or credits; only what a session can do itself.
- Method: the vendor's own published before/after pair, aligned onto PushUP's output
  (`bench/saas/compare_published.py`). Claid.ai: PushUP is clean and faithful but behind on
  fine texture (suede fibres). Follow-up: T7.

### [blocked] T3c — Repeat the published-sample comparison for more vendors
- **Goal:** add Let's Enhance, Pixelcut, Picsart, Topaz, Upscale.media samples to
  `docs/SAAS.md` with `bench/saas/compare_published.py` (one entry per vendor).
- **Blocked on:** each vendor's site and image CDN must be added to the environment's
  network allowlist, which needs an interactive session (owner approves host additions).

### [x] T7 — Close the texture gap (research, no product code) (done 2026-11-09, see docs/TEXTURE.md)
- **Goal:** find a model that produces Claid-like material texture (suede, knit, leather)
  without inventing wrong detail, that runs on CPU (any speed) and is worthwhile on a GPU.
- **Accept:**
  - Candidates from Hugging Face / OpenModelDB with a published ONNX export or a format our
    converters handle (`tools/build_*_onnx.py`), plus at least one generative / one-step
    diffusion SR model if an ONNX export exists. Record license, size, source and SHA-256.
  - For each: CPU time on the Claid sample (640×428 → 1000 px) and on one sub20 image,
    peak memory, and the crop comparison from `bench/saas/compare_published.py` (add the
    model as a column). Score on `bench/out/sub20` at 400 px with `bench/bench.js`.
  - `docs/TEXTURE.md`: table, crops (outside git), and a recommendation: which model (if
    any) should become the GPU `high` mode, with the evidence.
- **Notes:** CC BY-NC-SA licenses are acceptable (non-commercial project). Models that
  can't produce an ONNX file without PyTorch are out of scope — record them as such.
  Network available unattended: Hugging Face (models + datasets), PyPI/npm, GitHub release
  downloads and `git clone` (OpenModelDB data: `git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none
  --sparse https://github.com/OpenModelDB/open-model-database`), and `claid.ai` for the
  Claid sample. `github.com/<repo>/raw/...` and other sites are blocked — a model only
  available elsewhere is recorded as unreachable, not worked around.

### [blocked] T8 — Consider UltraSharpV2-Lite as the `high` model (owner decision)
- **Why:** T7 found it better than Remacri on GMSD/PSNR, 1.7x faster on CPU, 3x less memory
  (`docs/TEXTURE.md`). Changing a default model needs an owner-written decision.
- **Blocked on:** owner says go. Then: verify the license of the Lite weights (no OpenModelDB
  entry; the HF ONNX is a third-party conversion), build the ONNX ourselves or record upstream
  hash, run the quality gate (`PUSHUP_QUALITY=high PUSHUP_DEVICE=cpu`), update README and
  `models/LICENSES.md`.

### [ ] T1a — Measure how well text on packaging survives (research, no product code)
- **Goal:** Decide with data whether text needs special handling. Text on labels
  (ingredients, brand names, sizes) is where upscalers fail most visibly.
- **Accept:**
  - OCR engine (fixed, so results can't be steered): `rapidocr-onnxruntime` from PyPI with
    its bundled default models; record its version, model files, licenses and SHA-256.
  - Text test set: run that OCR on the 1000 px references from `bench/out/set`; keep text
    lines with recognition confidence ≥ 0.90 and ≥ 4 characters, as crops of the line box
    padded by 8 px (≥15 crops; list them in `docs/TEXT.md` with image name + box).
  - References are built exactly as `bench/bench.js` builds them (set image resized to
    1000 px on its largest side). Protocol: upscale the **whole image** from its 400 px and
    600 px degraded input (as the bench does), then cut the same box (top-left coordinates)
    from the output; if output and reference differ by 1 px after rounding, clip the box to
    the area both share, as the bench does. Score per crop = character accuracy
    `max(0, 1 − editDistance(ocr(out), ocr(ref)) / len(ocr(ref)))`; crops whose reference
    OCR text is empty are excluded. "Mean" = unweighted mean over crops.
  - Methods: Lanczos (baseline), `fast` and `high` (via `PUSHUP_QUALITY` in a small script;
    `high` takes ~15 s per 400 px image on CPU, so budget ~30 min for 15 images × 2 sizes).
  - Decision rule, applied at 400 px and written into `docs/TEXT.md`: recommend T1b if
    `fast`'s mean accuracy < 0.90, **or** ≥ 3 crops have `fast` accuracy < 0.50. Otherwise
    recommend closing T1b. Also report `fast − Lanczos` and `high − fast`: if `high` already
    fixes most failures, say so (text might only need `high` mode, not a new model).
  - `docs/TEXT.md` has the numbers, ≤6 side-by-side crops (images outside git if large) and
    the recommendation.

### [blocked] T1b — Text-aware upscaling
- **Goal:** detect text regions, upscale them with a text-specialised path, blend back.
- **Blocked on:** T1a's result only. The decision is the working session's, not the
  owner's: if T1a's decision rule recommends T1b, the session that finishes T1a sets T1b to
  `[ ]`, splits it into sub-tasks here (detector, text model, compositing, tests, benchmark)
  and records the decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. If the rule says no, set T1b to `[x]`
  closed with the evidence.

### [split] T1 — Text-on-packaging upscaler → see T1a (measure) and T1b (build).

### [x] Q1 — (done 2026-11-10, test/queue.test.js) Test: a failed call must not poison the queue, and calls run strictly in order
- **Goal:** `src/index.js` serialises calls through one promise queue. Pin that behaviour.
- **Accept:** new tests in `test/upscale.test.js`: (a) a call whose inference fails *inside the queue* (mock or wrap the session so `infer` throws;
  an out-of-range size is rejected before the queue and does not test this) followed by a valid
  call still resolves with correct output; (b) with 3 calls started
  together, inference runs one at a time and results arrive in call order (use same-size inputs, or assert order inside the stubbed `infer`; resolution order is not guaranteed for mixed sizes) (observable via a
  test hook or by wrapping the session, no sleeps); (c) `npm test` passes. No change to `src/`
  unless a test exposes a real bug (then fix it and say so in the PR) or a small test-only hook is
  needed for (a) or (b) (allowed; say so in the PR).

### [ ] Q2 — Test: input buffer is not modified; Buffer views with `byteOffset` work
- **Goal:** callers often pass slices of a bigger `Buffer` (pooled allocations).
- **Accept:** tests that (a) a copy of the input taken before `upscale` equals the input
  afterwards (byte for byte); (b) a `Buffer` that is a slice with non-zero `byteOffset`, and a
  `Uint8Array`, give byte-identical output to a freshly allocated copy of the same pixels.
  Fix `src/` only if a test fails, and document it.

### [ ] Q3 — Measure first-call latency (session creation) and document it
- **Goal:** `docs/PERF.md` says the first call pays session creation but doesn't measure it.
- **Accept:** `bench/profile.js` (or a small new script) reports cold first-call time vs warm
  median for `fast` (CPU) and, if feasible within the run, `high` (CPU) at 400 and 800 px (each cold measurement in a fresh process, since sessions are cached per model; `high` = `PUSHUP_QUALITY=high PUSHUP_DEVICE=cpu`; ≥ 3 warm calls for `fast`, ≥ 1 warm call for `high`; if `high`
  at 800 px takes too long for the run, measure it at 400 px only and say so);
  numbers and machine in `docs/PERF.md`; one sentence on whether pre-warming would help
  (no API change). No product code.

### [ ] Q4 — Per-source breakdown in `bench/bench.js`
- **Goal:** the set mixes Amazon (ABO) and Lamoda images; averages can hide a per-source
  regression.
- **Accept:** a `--by-source` flag adds rows grouped by file-name prefix (`abo_`, `lamoda_`) to
  the output table; output without the flag is identical to before apart from the `ms` column, which varies between
  runs (compare the `images:` line and the PSNR/SSIM/GMSD columns on `sub20` with `--sizes 400`;
  `--limit` takes the first files alphabetically, so it would only see `abo_` images); the
  `--by-source` run must show both `abo_` and `lamoda_` rows; usage line updated; the numbers for `lanczos,sr-full` at
  400 px on `sub20` go in the PR description.

### [ ] Q5 — README "Known limits" brought up to date
- **Goal:** the section still says the SaaS comparison needs an account (T3 did it from
  published samples) and doesn't point to the texture and text research.
- **Accept:** README bullets reflect `docs/SAAS.md` (T3), `docs/TEXTURE.md` (T7) and the
  current state of text handling (if T1a is still `[ ]` on `main`, read PR #19 / branch
  `overnight/2026-11-10-T1a`: it found only 7 usable text crops, need 15; state that, claim no result); all linked paths exist; `npm test` passes (the package test
  checks the tarball).
